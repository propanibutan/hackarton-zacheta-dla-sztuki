## About Hack(art)hon 2022

A sprint-like design event in developing educational open source tools for one of the largest cultural institutions in Poland – [Zachęta](https://zacheta.art.pl/en/?setlang=1) – National Gallery of Art.

The main objective is to prototype one of two potential online tools based on the online collections:

● An online tool aimed at teachers, using the Zachęta collection to develop students’ interest in art, outside the framework of the school curriculum. It should help to encourage students to explore digital artefacts on their own, discovering new art forms and engaging with them in creative ways.

● An online tool for users of the Encouragement website, with a particular focus on people with disabilities, that will facilitate friendly and easy exploration of the digital art collection in a way that meets the particular needs of people with disabilities. This tool could use solutions such as audiodescription, alternative descriptions or translation of films into Polish Sign Language, among others.

## About project

Together with my team EduDepth (**Arek Rataj**, **Bartłomiej Dzięgiel**, **Joanna Florczak**, **Joanna Jachowicz**, **Justyna Rawińska**) we build solution for education. Our goal was to make students more emotionally involved in lessons, to make art more appealing for them, to help teachers get access to high quality art reproductions in short time.
